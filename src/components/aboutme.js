      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p style={{width:'65%', margin: 'auto'}}>Currently pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree at Ryeson University. I have a passion for iOS development, I love the feeling of being able to create something from an idea. You can check out the different projects that I have developed in the project section. I am currently on an internship at IBM as a Watson Solutions Engineer. Aside from the technical aspect, I love playing pingpong and pool. </p>

      <h3 style={{paddingTop: '1em'}}>Education</h3>

      <p style={{width:'65%', margin: 'auto'}}>To reiterate what was said above, I am currently on my last year of my Electrical Engineering undergrad degree at Ryerson University with a minor in Buisness Managment. Aside from that, I am a selftaught iOS developer.</p>

      <h3 style={{paddingTop: '1em'}}>Passion</h3>

      <p style={{width:'65%', margin: 'auto'}}>I learn to make a difference. The main reason I got into app development is the fact that almost everyone we know has a smartphone. Yes we have to worry about marketing it but its very accessible, it all comes down to your imagination.</p>

      <h3 style={{paddingTop: '1em'}}>Goals</h3>

      <p style={{width:'65%', margin: 'auto'}}>My ultimate goal (at the moment) is having a full time iOS developer position in california. Being the hub for startups, the hunger for success and making an impact is huge. Putting in over 40 hours a week in learning/developement outside of my work time, I think I would be a great fit.</p>

      <h3 style={{paddingTop: '1em'}}>Milestones</h3>

      <p style={{width:'65%', margin: 'auto'}}>Need to work on this.</p>
